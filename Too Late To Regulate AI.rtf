I am passionate about this topic because I think sooner rather than later this is going to be a serious problem. Regulation has never been a sexy topic to discuss but with the rapid advancement of AI it\'92s important we talk about it and start acting on it. It\'92s going to take an enormous amount of money to create government agencies to form these regulation teams that would keep tech companies in check. We the tech community cannot go on and keep creating things just because we can, or say that\'92s what business is, or out of ego. There has to be some morality involved here. We are meant to make the world a better place but AI can reverse that effect in a matter of months if not days. Worst part is there will not be any one person to blame for all this, it will new a whole community, and we are part of it.}
